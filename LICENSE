The Befunge-93 specification is not open-source (yet), but it is freely
redistributable unmodified for non-commercial purposes.

The contributed Befunge-93 example sources are copyrighted by their respective
authors.  Except where otherwise noted, they are not open-source works,
but their contributors' willingness to allow them to be included in this
distribution implies that they are all freely redistributable unmodified for
non-commercial purposes.  If you wish to base your next best-selling novel
on one of them, you should seek out and contact its author for permission
first.  There is one exception: all Befunge-93 example sources in this
distribution which were written by Chris Pressey is in the public domain.
