Welcome to the NEW Befunge-93 Reference Distribution
====================================================

Since `bef` is a reference implementation (so far as it goes) of Befunge-93,
we saw fit to once again combine the specification and implementation into a
single distribution.

About Befunge-93
----------------

Befunge-93 is an esoteric programming language where the program exists in a
two-dimensional grid of cells, where each cell contains a single instruction,
and execution can proceed in any cardinal direction across this grid -- not
just left-to-right, but also right-to-left, top-to-bottom, and bottom-to-top.

For more information, see the Befunge-93 specification in the `doc` directory.
